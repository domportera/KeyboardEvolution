# KeyboardEvolution

This repo is to figure out what the most ergonomic keyboard layout is for [Thumb Key](https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key) by using some variation of evolutionary algorithms.

I'm basically just mucking about with the concept as I'm brand new to these sorts of algorithms. Depending on my interest, the breadth of applications may expand in the future.

I'm also not much of a keyboard nerd, I'm honestly just too lazy to get really good at more than one layout, and too impulsive to resist switching to a layout that turns out to be better. So I'm trying to settle the matter once-and-for-all through the brute force of darwinian logic.
